## Overview

The project addresses the important question of what factors contribute to wage differentials. The analysis considers the impact of education, experience, and gender on wages. The project aims to understand if there is a bias in wage determination and if factors like education and experience can offset gender-related wage differences.

## Research Questions

- Does gender play a role in wage determination?
- How do factors like education and experience impact wage differentials?
- Can one factor, such as experience, offset gender-related wage differences?

## Findings

- Gender does impact wage differentials, with women earning approximately 82 ¢ for every dollar earned by men.
- Education and experience are significant factors in wage determination.
- Experience is more beneficial than gender in terms of wage determination.

## Contribution

- The project provides valuable insights into the wage gap and highlights the importance of factors like education and experience in wage determination.
- The graphical analysis used in the project helps visualize trends and understand the wage gap better.

## Analysis Techniques

- Cross-validation
- Bootstrapping
- Pearson’s correlation
- Influence graph
- K-fold cross-validation

## Conclusion

The project concludes that while a gender wage gap exists, factors like education and experience can mitigate this gap. Further research is needed to understand the societal and systemic factors contributing to the wage gap.
